        <h1>EAST to WEST</h1>
        
        <p> Artist shows a birds eye view  into some of your favorite TV show's apartments and homes.  </p>
        
        <p> Iñaki Aliste Lizarralde is not only a young professional interior designer but as a hobby hand draws incredible floor plans of popular TV series and movies. These floor plans show you a different perspective of apartments and homes you've vicariously lived from episode to episode.</p>
        
        <p>The collection includes the likes of The Simpson, Dexter, Friends, Seinfeld, Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, How I Met Your Mother, and a handful others. Each of the floor plans is highly detailed, and not only includes the architectural side of things, but also goes into immense furnishing details really bringing these television shows to life. As a huge fan of a lot of these shows, this was definitely a project we could appreciate the amount of time and effort that was put in. Check out the floor plans below.</p>
